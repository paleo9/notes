* Introduction
Use emacs help to study a snippet at a time, come back to it, move onto
the next one, gradually expanding your knowledge.

All emacs help commands start with C-h

|-----+-----------------------------------------|
| C-h | Help for                                |
|-----+-----------------------------------------|
| ?   | all help key bindings                   |
| f   | functions                               |
| v   | variables                               |
| o   | functions or variables                  |
| k   | the given key binding                   |
| w   | which key the given command is bound to |
| m   | the current modes (major and minor      |

When the point is a over a symbol (proper name) of a function or variable,
the C-h f, C-h v or C-h o will use that as the default choice.
  
* C-h as a suffix
Begin typing the prefix of a command, then hit C-h. A help buffer opens up listing all the
functions bound to that comand prefix.

 * Type C-x r
 * Hit C-h
 * The help buffer displays all the C-x r commands - all the
commands relating to registers in this case.
