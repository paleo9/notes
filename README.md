# notes

My notes on a variety of subjects organised using the Emacs \'denote\' 
package or similar.

These notes have filenames created by the emacs package 
denote (https://github.com/protesilaos/denote).
Their format is 

> DateTime--file-name-components__keyword_keyword_keyword.xxx

where xxx may be txt, org, md or anything suitable. For example:

> 20231017T200541--learn-emacs-denote__packages.org

 * was created on 17 October 2023
 * it is part of my \'learn emacs\' series
 * it is about the \'denote\' package
 * I used the keyword \'packages\' to indicate that fact

This naming system:

* provides easier searching and filtering to find relevant content
* because it relies on carefully considered and well-chosen file names and keywords to indicate related information
* so allowing all notes to be kept in a single directory
* freeing you from concerns of file location and directory structure
